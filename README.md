## What is it?
EasyLocalize Lite is a lightweight version of EasyLocalize written on Swing.

EasyLocalize was created to simplify manual translation of macOS and iOS apps. It was made for people, who has little to no coding experience, that are localizing apps, so they can focus just on the process and language stuff, and not on the code styling etc.
